# Smart Punching Bag Energy Generator

## **Hey there!** ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to our Thesis project where we've built a punching bag that turns your punches into energy! ðŸ’¥ðŸ’¡ Hereâ€™s a quick rundown of what this is all about:

## **Whatâ€™s This About?**
We've created a smart punching bag that uses piezoelectric sensors to capture the energy from your punches. This AC-DC energy conversion turns your punches into a tool to charge your Phones. Cool, right? Iâ€™ve put together a Raspberry Pi and Arduino setup to make it all work.

## **Setup**

Setup is very straightforward just download the libraries needed, and of course the hardware you need. And you're good to go!

### **Hardware**
* Raspberry Pi 4
* Arduino UNO
* DC to DC Step-up Converter
* Bunch of PiezoElectric sensors
